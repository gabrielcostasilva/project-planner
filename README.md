# project-planner
This project is based on one of the many projects developed by [The Net Ninja (Shaun Pelling)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) on his excelent [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-vuejs-firebase).

Using Vue 3, the project consists of a root (App.vue, as always) and three child views: Home, AddProject and EditProject (.vue). The root view also has a navbar (Navbar.vue) whereas the Home view has two child components: FilterNav and SingleProduct (.vue).
